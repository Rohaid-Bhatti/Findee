# Findee - Lost and Found Ads Posting App

Findee is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users post ads for lost valuable items. The app provides a platform for different users to sign up, post ads, and search for lost items. Google Maps integration allows users to view the location of lost items and easily locate them. The app also provides functionality for users to manage their ads, including editing or deleting them.

Firebase is used for authentication, data storage, and push notifications.
